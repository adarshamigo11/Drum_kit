# Drum_kit

If you're looking to play the drums but don't have access to instruments, I've got you covered! I've created a drum kit using JavaScript's audio function, which allows you to play sounds simply by pressing keys. This fun and interactive drum kit is now available on GitHub for you to try out and enjoy.
